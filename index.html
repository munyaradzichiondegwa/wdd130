      <p>Hello! My name is Munyaradzi Chiondegwa and I am from Harare, Zimbabwe. I am half deaf. I enjoy reading, hiking, fishing and cricket. I am trying to learn Software development because I would like to improve the ability of the deaf community to communicate with everyone through the development of software that can turn words to sign vice versa</p>
